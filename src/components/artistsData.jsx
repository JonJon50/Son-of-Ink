        <p>I grew up in DMV, producing creative drawings from a young age. I have a passion for art and graphic design, along with several art show awards and publicized pieces of work.</p>
        <p>Although I have room to flourish in unlimited styles of tattoos, I have a fondness for American Traditional work. Iâ€™m still pushing my limits and expanding my skill set every day.</p>
